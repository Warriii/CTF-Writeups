### Learning With Mistakes - 10 Solves, 712 Pts, ðŸ©¸
```
Original LWE use field GF(prime). TFHE use Mod(2^n). I use GF(2^n) so that it's still a field so obviously mine is gonna be more secure lmao.

We are given two files, a learning-with-errors (LWE) implementation as well as a `log` file containing a sample output when the script is run. The idea seems rather straightforward. To get the flag, given the sample output we're supposed to recover the `key` used in the learning with errors encryption, and from there decrypt the flag.

The general principle behind a `LWE` cryptosystem revolves around the idea that to encrypt a message `m`, one normally generates a (typically 2-D) matrix `A`, dot products it with a secret `key` to get a 1-D vector result. This vector result is added by the message `m` which is expressed as another 1-D vector of equal dimension. Following which, an error vector `e` is added to this. The matrix `A` as well as `A*key + m + e` is returned as the ciphertext.

The security behind a `LWE` lies in that without `key`, one cannot deduce `A*key` and thus not recover `m + e`. It should be noted that normally `m` and `e` are set such that it is possible to distinguish `m` from `m + e`. The reasoning behind `e` is such that as `e` is always random, no matter how many pairs `(A, A*key + m + e)` you can get, even if you know all the `m` (thus getting `(A, A*key+e)` pairs), you simply cannot recover the `key` without having to guess for possible `e` vectors.

This security is absent in the implementation. Looking at `encrypt_mbits()`, we find that the `m` vector is of the form `{m0, m1, m2, m3, 0, 0, ...., 0}`, whereas the `e` vector is of the form `{0, 0, 0, 0, e0, e1, e2, ...., e27}`. Thus, if we can isolate out equations involving the first four terms of the ciphertext result, we can derive a bunch of `(A, A*key)` values by subtracting our known message vectors.

Since `encrypt_mbits()` is called 132 times, we obtain 528 different linear equations with 500 unknowns being the `key` vector itself. We can then perform Gaussian Elimination to recover `key`, and thus the flag.
