`main()` grants us access to the `print_file_contents()` function which prints whatever is inserted as the file input. We know that `flag.txt` exists in the system, but we can't access it as a `strstr()` check prevents us from doing so!

So we start looking for vulnerabilities. At first the program might seem secure, but in reality there's a cheekily hidden buffer overflow.

```c
char filename[100];
size_t end = read(0, filename, 0x100);
```
In main()'s stack frame, `filename` is initialised to have only 100 characters. Yet the `read()` call takes in 256 characters!

Running `checksec` tells us there's no canary, thus we can easily buffer overflow to overwrite the return address!

Now if we can have it call `print_file_contents("flag.txt")`, we can get our flag. To do this, we identify a `pop rdi; ret;` instruction in the program memory and first have our program return to that when `main()` ends. Following which, we use the address whereby `flag.txt` is stored in memory, being in the global `copypastas[]` variable to have the address of `flag.txt` popped into the `rdi` register.

We perform another `ret` gadget to [align our stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4175281/what-does-it-mean-to-align-the-stack), and then the `print_file_contents()` function address! Since `PIE` is disabled, the function addresses and global variable addresses are not randomised and static, allowing for our payload to work!

To overflow the buffer however, we will also need to ensure `main()` returns smoothly; We do this by having our first 8 bytes be `bob.txt\x00` so that `print_file_contents("bob.txt")` is called and it won't trigger any errors, resulting into a smooth return to our rop-chain.

pload = b'bob.txt\x00' + b'A'*(16*8) + p64(poprdi) + p64(flagtxt) + p64(poprdi+1) + p64(printfile)
p.recvuntil(b"input copypasta to read: ")
p.sendline(pload)
p.interactive()
