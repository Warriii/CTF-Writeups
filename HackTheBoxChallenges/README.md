During the last week of May 2025 I was invited to organise and hold a workshop introducing cryptography to beginners as part of a collaboration with NUS Greyhats and HackTheBox (HTB). The workshop featured a quick introduction by myself with accompanying slides detailing an overview of solving cryptography challenges and some cryptographic theories, followed with a curation of 10 challenges from HTB!

Near the end of the workshop I was asked by one of the participants as to whether I will be providing writeups for the challenges. Thus, this repository folder came to be! I will first detail in the 10 challenges, and if I were to happen to write any other writeups for HTB challenges, it will be placed here as well!
