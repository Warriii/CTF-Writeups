### Grey Divers (155 Solves, 100 Pts)
We are given the description,
```
Grey Cat has recently got into playing Hell Divers 2 before it disappeared and left this note behind:

Eagle 500 Kg Bomb
GL-21 Grenade Launcher
MD-I4 Incendiary Mines
Orbital Gas Strike
Orbital Airburst Strike
Eagle Rearm
Eagle 110MM Rocket Pods
Can you decipher what it is trying to say?
```
as well as an image file, ![alt text](Images/greydivers.png)

Now in the game Hell Divers 2, these words correspond to Strategems that players can summon to aid them. Hilariously in order to summon them you must enter a sequence of `UP` `DOWN` `LEFT` `RIGHT` arrow keys. We use a website to decode the arrow keys, and apply them onto the png to obtain the flag.
