## Mazeware (2 Solves, 1000 Pts, ðŸ©¸)

In Reverse Engineering there's generally two ways of analysis; Static analysis, where one just analyses source code, and Dynamic analysis, where with the help of tools one can run a program to some defined point. Dynamic analysis in particular is super helpful as we get to see what a program or executable does in each and every step of the analysis. This writeup covers my solution to `Mazeware` and how I was able to achieve this through `IDA` and a bunch of breakpoint debugging.

This writeup is broken up into 3 sections.

- [A Cursory Glance](#a-cursory-glance), where we generally make sense of the executable and note anything out of the ordinary
- [The Hidden Path](#the-hidden-path), where we spot a strange lead from our notes
- [Shifting Walls](#shifting-walls), as we pursue said lead and learn of this maze's self-changing property
- [Tunnel's End](#tunnels-end), where we eventually find the metaphorical light / flag at the end of this ever-changing labyrinth!

## A Cursory Glance

Let's start by playing around with it. Launching it on a Linux VM we notice a Banner;

![alt text](Images/image-2.png)

Followed by our first maze! It appears we can use `WASD` to navigate our character, a `^`, through a maze of `#`s and `' '`s until we reach a destination `F`!

![alt text](Images/image-3.png)

The second maze is no different either.

![alt text](Images/image-4.png)

And then the third....huh. We're left with an impossible maze. Let's start by analysing the executable.

![alt text](Images/image-5.png)

### main
---
Opening up the executable we see that on the surface level its a maze simulator. `main()` loads `offset_4041C0` that we later see is used in `_printf()` to print a standard intro banner of sorts.

![alt text](Images/image-1.png)

`sub_4019E1()` is then called after one `_getchar()`.

### sub_4019E1 / maze_main
---
```cpp
void maze_main()
{
  unsigned __int8 x_coord; // [rsp+5h] [rbp-Bh]
  unsigned __int8 y_coord; // [rsp+6h] [rbp-Ah]
  unsigned __int8 input_char; // [rsp+7h] [rbp-9h]
  unsigned __int8 v3; // [rsp+7h] [rbp-9h]
  char v4; // [rsp+7h] [rbp-9h]
  int nrounds; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-8h]

  for ( nrounds = 0; nrounds <= 2; nrounds = 4 )
  {
    do
    {
      x_coord = (unsigned __int16)sub_401704((__int16 *)mazeData[nrounds]) >> 8;
      y_coord = sub_401704((__int16 *)mazeData[nrounds]) & 0xF;
      sub_4017CD(mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord);
      do
      {
        input_char = getchar();
        if ( input_char > '`' )
          input_char -= 32;
        if ( input_char > '@' )
        {
          v3 = input_char - 'A';
          if ( v3 )
          {
            if ( v3 / 3u - v3 % 3u == 1 )
            {
              if ( sub_40173D((unsigned __int8 *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord + 1, y_coord) )// D
                ++x_coord;
            }
            else
            {
              v4 = v3 - 18;
              if ( v4 )                         // W
              {
                if ( v4 == 4 && sub_40173D((unsigned __int8 *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord - 1) )
                  --y_coord;
              }
              else if ( sub_40173D((unsigned __int8 *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord + 1) )// S
              {
                ++y_coord;
              }
            }
          }
          else if ( sub_40173D((unsigned __int8 *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord - 1, y_coord) )
          {
            --x_coord;                          // A
          }
        }
      }
      while ( !(unsigned int)sub_4017CD(mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord) );
      printf("\n\tNext level? Enter to continue...");
      getchar();
      getchar();
      ++nrounds;
    }
    while ( nrounds != 3 );
    sub_40147C();
  }
}
```

We observe a while loop that goes up to 3, as well as a `do-while` within that repeatedly gets user input. Quick intuition reveals that the user input keys most relevant to this are `WASD`, which is followed by a `sub_40173D()` call and then modifying a variable by `+-1`. It becomes super apparent that the variables are x and y coordinates, with `sub_4017CD()` checking for a collision and `sub_401704()` loading the x and y starting coordinates for a given maze. Its very much implied that we can solve each maze, which brings us to the next level and increments `nrounds` by 1. Once `nrounds == 3`, `sub_40147C()` is called.

There is something peculiar with this, however. Notice that `mazeData[nrounds]` is used to determine which maze is being printed. Looking into the global `mazeData` variable we observe

![alt text](Images/image-8.png)

Which is odd, considering there's 2 more entries below. Yet `nrounds` would only reach `3`, and the highest that we'd go is `mazeData[2]`!

We'll note this anomaly at the back of our mind and move on.

```
Anomaly 1: Additional data entries beneath mazeData, addresses 0x4058D0 and 0x4058D8 containing values 0x4016FE and 0x4014C5
```

We also see `sub_4017CD()` being called before and within each iteration of the `do-while`. We'll delve into this later. But first, let's see what our reward is at the end...

### sub_40147C / win_func

![alt text](Images/image.png)

`sub_40147C()` seems relatively simple, calling `sub_40143F5()` which writes something into `s` that it then calls `puts()` on, printing it onto stdout.

`sub_4013F5()` is a bit more complicated, but IDA's decompiled pseudocode gives us all that we need.

```cpp
__int64 __fastcall sub_4013F5(__int64 key_array, __int64 ciphertext_array, __int64 output_array)
{
  char keystream_out[264]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-110h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v6; // [rsp+128h] [rbp-8h]

  v6 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  sub_40122E((const char *)key_array, (__int64)keystream_out);
  sub_4012FB((__int64)keystream_out, (const char *)ciphertext_array, output_array);
  return 0LL;
}

__int64 __fastcall sub_40122E(const char *key_array, char *keystream_buffer)
{
  int v3; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-10h]
  int i; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-Ch]
  int j; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]
  int v6; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-4h]

  v6 = strlen(key_array);
  LOBYTE(v3) = 0;
  for ( i = 0; i <= 255; ++i )
    keystream_buffer[i] = i;
  for ( j = 0; j <= 255; ++j )
  {
    v3 = (unsigned __int8)(keystream_buffer[j] + v3 + key_array[j % v6]);
    sub_4011F6(&keystream_buffer[j], &keystream_buffer[v3]);
  }
  return 0LL;
}

__int64 __fastcall sub_4012FB(char *keystream_buffer, const char *ciphertext_array, char *output_array)
{
  int i; // [rsp+24h] [rbp-1Ch]
  int j; // [rsp+28h] [rbp-18h]
  size_t ptr; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-10h]
  size_t ciphertext_length; // [rsp+38h] [rbp-8h]

  LOBYTE(i) = 0;
  LOBYTE(j) = 0;
  ptr = 0LL;
  ciphertext_length = strlen(ciphertext_array);
  while ( ptr < ciphertext_length )
  {
    i = (unsigned __int8)(i + 1);
    j = (unsigned __int8)(keystream_buffer[i] + j);
    sub_4011F6(&keystream_buffer[i], &keystream_buffer[j]);
    output_array[ptr] = keystream_buffer[(unsigned __int8)(keystream_buffer[i] + keystream_buffer[j])] ^ ciphertext_array[ptr];
    ++ptr;
  }
  return 0LL;
}
```

`sub_4013F5()` is very reminsicient of a popular decryption algorithm, `RC4`. It takes in a `key[]` array, ciphertext `ct[]` array, then from the key runs a key scheduling algorithm which we see in `sub_40122E()`. Then, in the actual decryption function `sub_4012FB()` it generates a keystream which it uses to xor with the ciphertext to obtain some `pt[]` array.

Let's try and run this right away to see what we get! We quickly simulate this with python, get `unk_4040C0` as our ciphertext and `unk_405340` as our key.

We notice an interesting anomaly as we head to `unk_405340` however. As we can see,
![alt text](Images/image-7.png)

There exists an entire 664-length word buffer in `word_405380`! This doesnt seem related to what we have found at all, but for time being let us leave this in the back of our mind.

```
Anomaly 2: Strange unused massive buffer right after the 64-byte key array, address 0x405380
```

```py
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4

key = bytes.fromhex("4455621D5D46F92C325E625FB595F69E674B3A29980C129019E8C1B4F7A60B22")
ct = bytes.fromhex("8BF24A8B9EEB29E637F0B3F4B9BE1F1753E32F4B4E6706CF06CA84E1BB0B383EC58CC9A8721D3CBBBE26B8")

cipher = ARC4.new(key=key)
print(cipher.decrypt(ct)) # b'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'
```

...hm. Something's off here. This decrypts to the Youtube link to Rick Astley's hit song Never Gonna Give You Up! It's clearly not the flag.

Seeing that there's so much more left in the binary to dissect, it is more likely that at some point some modification is made, be it to either the key or the ciphertext. Going back to `maze_main()`, `sub_4017CD()` has yet to be reversed. Let's take a look at it and proceed from there.

## The Hidden Path

Taking a glance at `sub_4017CD()`...

### sub_4017CD / print_maze
```cpp
__int64 __fastcall print_maze(char *mazeData, int x_coord, int y_coord)
{
  int v5; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-3Ch]
  int v6; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-2Ch]
  int i; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-28h]
  int v8; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-24h]
  unsigned int v9; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-20h]
  int j; // [rsp+24h] [rbp-1Ch]
  int v11; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-10h]
  int v12; // [rsp+38h] [rbp-8h]

  v5 = x_coord;
  puts("\x1B[H\x1B[2J\n\n");
  puts("\tW A S D to navigate");
  if ( x_coord == -1 && y_coord == -1 )
  {
    y_coord = mazeData[1];
    v5 = mazeData[3];
  }
  v11 = mazeData[4];
  v6 = 0;
  for ( i = 0; i < v11; ++i )
    v6 += mazeData[5];
  v12 = v11 * *mazeData + mazeData[2];
  v8 = 0;
  v9 = 0;
  putchar(9);
  for ( j = 0; j < v6; ++j )
  {
    if ( v8 == v11 * y_coord + v5 )
    {
      if ( v8 == v12 )  v9 = 1;
      putchar('^');
    }
    else if ( v8 == v12 ) putchar('F');
    else if ( (((int)(unsigned __int8)mazeData[v8 / 8 + 6] >> (7 - v8 % 8)) & 1) != 0 ) putchar('#');
    else putchar(' ');
    if ( !(++v8 % v11) ) printf("\n\t");
  }
  return v9;
}
```

This function seems pretty simple as well. Given a maze data object, it reads it in a custom manner and then prints the maze accordingly. `^` is our player character, `F` the destination, while `#` and `' '` serve as walls and passages respectively. `\n\t`, or rather newlines, are printed when necessary to move to the next row.

This explains what we've observed when running the binary pretty well, with this function only existing to print the maze.

By this point it would seem that everything has been analysed already. All of the functions that `main()` would call, bar those that I've deemed simple enough to omit from this writeup, have been done.

### Breakthrough..?
---

What are we still missing? Clueless as to what's going on, we quickly reference our anomalies.

```
Anomaly 1: Additional data entries beneath mazeData, addresses 0x4058D0 and 0x4058D8 containing values 0x4016FE and 0x4014C5
Anomaly 2: Strange unused massive buffer right after the 64-byte key array, address 0x405380
```

Let's start with Anomaly 1. We head to the address `0x4058D0` and use IDA's xref utility to determine if the binary calls this at any point in time;
![alt text](Images/image-9.png)

Wait...`print_maze`?! But we've just looked at it from the pseudocode. We look through the disassembly this time and spy a suspicious return call:
![alt text](Images/image-6.png)

where we see 
```
mov rsp, off_4058D0
mov eax, [rbp+var_20]
retn
```
being called. The `rsp` is a stack register that is usually used to indicate where one is on the stack, and is used to tell our computer / CPU where in the binary to move it to after a `retn` or similar instruction is hit, i.e. reaching the end of the current function. 

More importantly, it also controls the `return address`, or rather the next place where the CPU will look for instructions to resume execution. Normally when you call a function `a()` in say,

```cpp
int b() {
    return 1
    }
int a() {
    return b() + 99
    }
```

Right at the end of `b()`, at the `ret` instruction the `rsp` would by default point to somewhere in `a()`, at the instruction after a `call b()` assembly instruction is made. Normally in assembly the `rsp` value is either offsetted by some integer value to bring it back, but in here we see that it is deliberately set to `off_4058D0`!

It also seems that because of how little it contributes with the rest of the code, perhaps that is why IDA's decompiler would miss out on it when generating its pseudocode output. Hence why we've missed out on this earlier.

Going back to the assembly, we see that when `ret` is called, `rsp` containing `0x4058D0` would point to `sub_4016FE`. This particular function is secretly being called after `print_maze()`!

### sub_4016FE / jump_rax
---
![alt text](Images/image-10.png)

Unfortunately it seems we arrive on a dead end. `jump_rax()` basically pops the top value of the stack and places it in `rax`. It then does some movement of the `rsp` and `rbp` registers, before calling `jmp` to `rax`, meaning it begins executing its remaining instructions from the value contained in `rax` onwards.

Without access to the stack, statically we might not be able to see where it goes, unless we do a bunch more backtracking. Thus, we just allow the binary to run up to a certain point, then follow it through instruction by instruction!

We set a breakpoint right here back in `print_maze()`,
![alt text](Images/image-11.png)

then run the executable on IDA. EVentually it halts at our breakpoint and we begin stepping over each instruction, into `jump_rax()` where see the new value of `rax` after `pop rax`;

![alt text](Images/image-12.png)

`sub_4014C5()`, the second entry in the two data entries we've found beneath `mazeData`! This resolves our first Anomaly as we see them being used.

### sub_4014C5() / secret_func

We first attempt to view this in decompiled pseudocode, and find it rather unhelpful
```cpp
// write access to const memory has been detected, the output may be wrong!
void sub_4014C5()
{
  void (*v0)(); // rbx
  _BYTE *v1; // rdi
  bool v2; // zf
  _BYTE *v3; // rsi
  __int64 v4; // rcx
  _QWORD *v5; // rbx
  __int64 i; // r9
  _QWORD *v7; // r10
  __int64 v8; // r8
  char *v9; // rdi
  __int64 v10; // rcx
  __int64 v11; // r9
  void *v12; // r10
  void (*v13)(); // rax
  __int64 (__fastcall *v14)(char *, int, int); // rax
  __int64 j; // rcx
  _QWORD v16[3]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-28h]
  void (*v17)(); // [rsp+18h] [rbp-10h]

  v0 = (void (*)())((unsigned __int64)&printf & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF000LL);
  do
  {
    v0 = (void (*)())((char *)v0 + 4096);
    v1 = (char *)v0 - 1;
    v3 = (char *)v0 - 513;
    v2 = v0 == (void (*)())513;
    v4 = 512LL;
    do
    {
      if ( !v4 )
        break;
      v2 = *v3-- == *v1--;
      --v4;
    }
    while ( v2 );
  }
  while ( !v2 );
  __asm { syscall; LINUX - }
  v17 = v0;
  v5 = (_QWORD *)((char *)v0 - 4096);
  while ( 1 )
  {
    for ( i = 10LL; ; --i )
    {
      if ( !i )
      {
        v7 = v5 - 18;
        v8 = 0LL;
        v9 = (char *)&word_405380[1] + word_405380[0];
        v10 = -(__int64)word_405380[0];
        v11 = 0LL;
        while ( 1 )
        {
          *((_BYTE *)v7 + v8++) = byte_405340[v11] ^ v9[v10++];
          if ( ++v11 == 32 )
            v11 = 0LL;
          if ( !v10 )
          {
            *(_QWORD *)((char *)v7 + 78) = &getchar;
            __asm { syscall; LINUX - }
            v12 = (char *)v7 + 41;
            off_404040 = v12;
            __asm { syscall; LINUX - sys_mprotect }
            v13 = sub_4014C5;
            v17 = sub_4014C5;
            do
              v13 = (void (*)())((char *)v13 + 1);
            while ( *(_DWORD *)v13 != -98693133 );
            v16[2] = (char *)v13 - (char *)sub_4014C5;
            v14 = print_maze;
            do
              v14 = (__int64 (__fastcall *)(char *, int, int))((char *)v14 + 1);
            while ( (*(_DWORD *)v14 ^ 0xDEADBEEF) != 491649892 );
            v16[1] = 15LL;
            v16[0] = 0x52C89480A000000LL;
            for ( j = 0LL; ; ++j )
            {
              *((_BYTE *)v14 + j) ^= *((_BYTE *)v16 + j);
              if ( j == 9 )
                break;
            }
            *(_QWORD *)((char *)v14 - 7) = 0x8B90909090909090LL;
            *(_BYTE *)v17 = 0;
            __asm { retn }
          }
        }
      }
      v5 += 2;
      if ( *v5 )
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

Not only are we told that our output might be wrong, but there's a bunch of odd `__asm {}` calls scattered throughout. IDA is having problems fully visualising the code, thus we stick back to our trusted disassembler view and interpret the assembly, instruction by instruction.

![alt text](Images/image-13.png)

The first few instructions seem complex at first but digestable. We notice `rbx` is set to `printf`'s address in the `got.plt` section. The `got.plt` section contains links to addresses where certain functions can be found in a libc, which in this case would be the provided libc's `printf` function address. `rbx &= 0xffff...ff000`. This places us in a slightly different spot from where the `printf` originally was.

Following which, we see that `rbx` goes from its current value, to `+0x1000`, `+0x2000`, ... in some loop. At each iteration, we observe `rdi = rbx - 1`, `rsi = rdi - 0x200` and `rcx = 0x200`.

`std` is called which sets the Directional Flag `DF` to 1.

Then `repe cmpsb` is called. Let's start with `repe`, which stands for `repeat if equal`. This repeats the instruction while `rcx != 0` and the Zero
Flag `ZF = 1` 

`cmpsb` compares byte at address `DS:(E)SI` with byte at address `ES:(E)DI` and sets the status flags `(CF, OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF)` accordingly to the result of the comparison. If the bytes aren't the same, `ZF = 0`, which would break the `repe` loop. The instruction would then end, causing `jnz` to trigger and thus bringing us back to the start.

In order for `ZF = 1` at the end, `RSI` and `RDI` must contain the same byte at all times, as `RSI` and `RDI` decrement (due to `DF` = 1) for a total of `rcx` times. This way, `repe` exits with `ZF = 1`.

And it just so happens that at that point in our libc, the data from address `rsi` to address `rdi` contain nothing but `0`s. Interestingly, not all the `0x1000` bytes are NULL, but this will be handled later.

![alt text](Images/image-14.png)

This allows us to have a completely free address space in the libc to work with. From an exploiter's point of view, if we can write our own shellcode in here, we can then run it in the binary.

And we notice it in the third box! Notice that when `syscall` is called, `rax = (1 << 3 ) - (-2) = 10`, `rdi = rbx - 0x1000`, `rsi = 0x1000` and `rdx = 7`. Looking at the syscall table (see [Syscall Table](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md)), we find that this does:

`mprotect(rdi, 0x1000, 7)`

which sets the permissions for `0x1000` bytes starting from `rdi` to be `Read, Write, Execute`!

We move on to the next portion; While it is a bit complex, we can statically analyse and reduce this to;

![alt text](Images/image-15.png)

```py
rbx = ...

# Loop on the right side which goes first
while True:
  r9 = 10
  while r9:
    rbx += 16
    if rbx[0] != 0:
      break
    r9 -= 1

# loc_401547 onwards
r15 = get_char_libc_addr
rdi = anomaly_2_buffer
libc_segment_start = rbx
sz_offset = (__int16) rdi[0] # i.e. first two bytes of anomaly_2_buffer[]
anomaly2_start = rdi[sz_offset+2:]
for i in range(sz_offset):
  libc_segment_start[i] = anomaly2_start[i] ^ key_array[i % 32]
```

The first loop increments rbx / start of our mprotect() region till it reaches a bunch of NULLs; This handles the fact that the start of our mprotect() region isnt all NULLs, and moves past it.

The next segment simply takes the unknown buffer we found as Anomaly2, as well as the key array, then computes some offset from Anomaly2. It then xors the data from Anomaly2 with the key array and writes it into our mprotect() region, up till size equal to the first 2 bytes of Anomaly2.

Clearly we see that the code decrypts and writes data into this blank libc area.

![alt text](Images/image-16.png)

The next block shows `mprotect()` finally used to set the perms from `RWX` to just `RX`, preventing it from being writable. At the same time, `r15`, which had the `get_char` address in `libc`, is written into the `mprotect` region before it got reset to `RX`. Then we see `getchar@got.plt` changed to `r10`, or the start of our decrypted payload.

For the non pwners and revvers, the `got.plt` section is a table in a binary that contains maps. Normally when compiling a binary, it would be a pain for one to always code in the backend code for common functions like `strlen()`, `getchar()` etc. Plus, having to add such code for every binary gives each one so much more unnecessary space in our file system. 

This is where the `libc` comes in, where a libc file would contain these functions. During runtime, the `libc` will communicate with our binary and tell it where `strlen()`, `getchar()` etc. can be found within it. Our binary would then follow accordingly and update the `got.plt` table containing the `libc` addresses with the corresponding functions.

That way, our binary doesn't have to store instructions on how to execute these basic common functions, and can rely on some other file to get instructions from! This is super useful utility wise, since now instead of having to copy and paste code for `strlen()` in every binary we compile, we just need a single instance of it in a `libc` for our binaries to refer to.

In a similar vein, the same works for the `getchar` entry of the `got.plt` table. When our code wants to call `getchar()`, it looks for it in `got.plt` which would by right point to the libc's location of `getchar`.

However, due to the assembvly code above, when our binary calls `getchar()`, `got.plt` points towards the malicious payload instead! You might wonder why the program seems to still be able to accept `getchar()` as if it were called normally. Chances are at some point, the malicious payload would call the proper `getchar()`, and then reflect the results to the user. The former is illustrated in the `mov [r10+78], r15` instruction. 

In cybersecurity this type of thing is called function hooking. Attached is a picture I've found online that illustrates how hooking works in general ([source](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/programming-beginners/128255-make-your-own-dll-hack-3-function-hooking-easier-than-ever.html))

![alt text](Images/image-17.png)

Nonetheless, we can breakpoint right where `mov ds:getchar_gotplt, r10` is called as shown above, and then look into `r10` to see the hooked `getchar()` function that was decrypted from Anomaly 2!

As for the remainder of `secret_func()`, another set of syscalls and loops are done, mainly to erase the Anomaly1 evidence in `print_maze()` by changing the instructions in there to `0x90` or `nop` bytes. I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader.

Once this ends, `print_maze()` from before prints the first maze without an issue, and we go back to standard execution flow! The only issue is that now, `getchar()` has been hooked for unknown purposes.

Before we move on, let's double check on the 2 anomalies we've found;

```
Anomaly 1: Additional data entries beneath mazeData, addresses 0x4058D0 and 0x4058D8 containing values 0x4016FE and 0x4014C5
Anomaly 2: Strange unused massive buffer right after the 64-byte key array, address 0x405380
```

It appears we've found how both of these have been used in hooking the `getchar` entry of the `got.plt` table! Nice! Both of these have been covered here, so chances are we no longer have much leads to pursue with these two...although there is the issue that a good chunk of `Anomaly2`'s buffer was not used in `secret_func()`...we'll keep this in mind later.

With this sorted, it's time for us to take a look at the `getchar` hook and see what is really going on here. It would appear much like how we are dealing with a self-modifying binary, this too is rather akin to a self-modifying maze..

## Shifting Walls

```
From this point onwards, the attached .i64 file would not help as much, as in order to get to here one must have ran the binary to some degree.

It is recommended for you to follow the steps in The Hidden Path, then save a snapshot on (presumably) a VM that you've run the binary on to save your progress!
```

Knowing that `getchar()` has been hooked, the next reasonable step aside from investigating the hooked code would be to see where else in the program's natural execution flow would `getchar()` be called. Surprisingly enough, there's only 3 other instances where it's called, and all can be found in `maze_main()`!

```cpp
for ( nrounds = 0; nrounds <= 2; nrounds = 4 )
  {
    do
    {
      x_coord = (unsigned __int16)get_starting_coordinates((__int16 *)mazeData[nrounds]) >> 8;
      y_coord = get_starting_coordinates((__int16 *)mazeData[nrounds]) & 0xF;
      print_maze((char *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord);
      do
      {
        v2 = getchar();
        if ( v2 > '`' )
          v2 -= 32;
        if ( v2 > '@' )
        {
          input_char = v2 - 'A';
          if ( input_char )
          ...
```
The first is right after the maze is printed, where the user input is acquired.

```cpp
          ...
          }
          else if ( check_boundaries((unsigned __int8 *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord - 1, y_coord) )
          {
            --x_coord;                          // A
          }
        }
      }
      while ( !(unsigned int)print_maze((char *)mazeData[nrounds], x_coord, y_coord) );
      printf("\n\tNext level? Enter to continue...");
      getchar();
      getchar();
      ++nrounds;
    }
```
And the other two are after finishing a maze, where it takes in two characters before loading a new maze.

With that in mind, let's begin analysing our hooked `getchar()`.

![alt text](Images/image-18.png)

We start off with `mov rax, rsp`, assigning `rax` to contain the value of `rsp`. As far as Intel Assembly is concerned, suppose we have a series of instructions like say,

```
0x1336: mov rdx, 7
0x133D: call func
0x1341: mov rbx, rax
(note the addresses may be very, very inaccurate of what such a set of instructions could look like)
```
for example, notice that every instruction consists of an address. Addresses store the location of an instruction, so that if we ever need to move to a new instruction, we can give an address and the program would know where to go accordingly. You might realise this is how `jmp`, `jz`, `jnz` operands as well as how function calling operates.

When a new function is called, `call func` would cause the `rip` register, which always contain the address of the current instruction, to move to the start of `func`. But then how does the program know where to return to once `func` is done? This is where the `rsp` comes in! The `rsp` would store the location of the next instruction after `call func`, slightly indirectly. In the example above, when `func` is called, `rsp` would contain a pointer to the stack that has the next instruction's location, `0x1341`.

Thus, in our case, the initial `mov rax, rsp`, would simply load the next instruction after a `call getchar()` instruction.

Thus, in the first instance our hooked `getchar` is called, `rsp` would point to the location on the stack with the value `0x401A7C`, right after the next `call _getchar` as shown:

![alt text](Images/image-19.png)
![alt text](Images/image-20.png)

Returning to our hooked function, we see `rax` consistently
added by `4`, as it moves down the stack until it contains `0x0f13110a` (`0xdeadbeef ^ 0xd1beafe5`). Upon meeting the condition, if the previous group of 4 instruction bytes is `1`, something happens as we see in `the_fun_part`. Otherwise, it just jumps to where `getchar()` is normally stored in the libc. Note that this does not jump to `getchar()` on the `got.plt` section which would otherwise lead to an endless recursion call on the hooked function. Rather, it calls the location of `getchar()` in the libc directly. The program is able to figure out the exact address where it is loaded in precisely because of that `mov [r10+78], r15` instruction way back in `secret_func`

We set a breakpoint at `mov ecx, [rax-4]` so as to monitor how this value to be stored in `ecx` changes with each `getchar()` input, and play with the maze a little.

![alt text](Images/image-21.png)

Interestingly however, no matter how often we play with the maze, the value in the stack is always `0`.

Then the magic happens. The exact instant we solve the first maze, and press Enter to continue and load the second maze,

![alt text](Images/image-22.png)

It now contains `1`! This passes the check and we finally get to `the_fun_part`.

![alt text](Images/image-23.png)

A few things happen here.

`push rax` pushes the value in `rax`, `0x0f13110a`, onto the stack. This is done as `rax` would later be modified for a `syscall`, and as we see it merely temporarily stores the value and writes it back into `rax` with the `pop rax` instruction after the `syscall`.

We then see `rdi`, containing the address of `start_of_something_new`, get bitwise-and with `0xffff...ff000` which sets `rdi` all the way back to the start of the original `mprotect` buffer first set in `secret_func`.

A `syscall mprotect` is then made, making the same, original `0x1000` buffer writable again. Something fishy is going on here...

![alt text](Images/image-25.png)

The next instructions after the syscall are a bit odd as they do some xoring and getting some data from the stack, but we mainly notice the reappearance of our `Anomaly2[]` buffer from before as it is loaded into `rsi`. We aslo notice the first two bytes of the `Anomaly2[0x1C0:]` buffer being loaded into `rcx`, possibly containing another offset or size-related data much like in `secret_func`. In this case, `rcx` contains `0x362`. `inc rsi` is called twice naturally, to move past the 2 bytes in `Anomaly2[0x1C0:]` that had been used to dictate the presumably length of input buffer to decrypt and write into.

![alt text](Images/image-24.png)

The next series of instructions loads the address of the `set_r8_to_2` instruction block into `rdi`, as we see in `lea rdi, set_r8_to_2`, thus `rdi` now contains, in this case, `0x00007FD32DFBC41D`.

Then `decrement_r8` and `inc_rd_till_babe1337` occur, whereby `rdi`, or rather the address where `set_r8_to_2` was located in, is incremented until its 4 bytes contain `0xbabe1337`. This is done TWICE (observe when `dec r8` is called, and what `test r8 r8` does here). 

But what does this mean?

Well, much like how recipes in a cookbook require words, so to do our program instructions require bytes! In fact, when we set IDA to display our instructions with assembly bytecode attached, we get something like this:

![alt text](Images/image-26.png)

Where `48 FF C7` represents `inc rdi`, for example in `0x00007FD32DFBC427`. `0x00007FD32DFBC42A` which is 3 bytes after would contain `8B 17`, representing `mov edx, [rdi]`.

We can somewhat understand why it looks for `babe1337` twice. Naturally the instruction `cmp edx, 0BABE1337h` would have contained the exact bytes, and presumably the binary intends to go further. We scroll down through the instructions and their assembly opcodes and find the next instance in which `0BABE1337h` appears.

![alt text](Images/image-27.png)

All the way at the very end! By this point, `rdi` would have incremented through the entirety of this function block, which we shall keep in mind for later.

We see `push rdi` called, pushing the final location of the end of hooked `getchar()` onto the stack. More specifically, at this point `rdi` would contain `0x00007FD32DFBC501`.

`cld` sets the Directional Flag / `DF` to 0. `push rcx` is done as `rcx` would be modified by the next instruction, so we can later restore its previous value via `pop rcx` right after `rep movsb`.

`rep` stands for `repeat while equal`, and `movsb` moves a byte from address `rsi` into address `rdi`. Thus, a byte from `Anomaly2[]` (represented by `rsi`) is appended to the end of the function block in hooked `getchar()` (represented by `rdi`). This is repeated until `rcx == 0` (i.e. `0x362` times), and every iteration increments `rsi` and `rdi` by 1. 

Because `DF = 0`, the two registers are incremented during the `rep movsb` instruction call, whereas back in `secret_func`, `DF = 1` causes the two to decrement during the `repe cmpsb` call.

And so, as `rep movsb` ends, we see `0x362` bytes from `Anomaly2[]` get copied over into the end of hooked `getchar()`, as shown:
![alt text](Images/image-28.png)

We move on to the next series of instructions;

![alt text](Images/image-29.png)

`xor_decrypt_loop` reuses the `key[]` array from before to xor the new payload data written from `0x00007FD32DFBC501`, as well as to further xor with `rbx`, which we had previously determined to contain `0xF17511AD` from before.

`set_rax_to_0` ensures that `key[]` never goes past its `32nd` value, and once the xor decryption is done, `post_xor_decrypt_loop` is the next set of instructions to be carried out as evinced in `ja short post_xor_decrypt_loop`, which jumps only when `rdx > rcx`. We've already determined `rcx` as the size of data written over from `Anomaly2[]`, and we observe `rdx` being used as an index that goes from 0 onwards.

In fact, once all of this is done, we see the second payload data decrypted to form what seems to be a legible function, as shown:

![alt text](Images/image-30.png)

As for the remaining part of hooked `getchar()`, it's a bit confusing, but I'll try my best to explain here.

![alt text](Images/image-31.png)

`lea rax, set_rax_to_0` and the first half of `dec_rax_till_fceb5dc3` does something similar to the `babe1337` that we'd observed prior, which stores the start of our hooked block into `rax`. We can verify it by following the bytecodes as `rax` is decremented slowly, or by referencing the final [commented instructions](#hooked-getchar-commented-assembly) that I've pulled from the binary at the end of this section.

We also see another rehook to our `getchar@got.plt` entry, with `pop rdi` taking the value from the top of our stack (which occurs way back in `0x00007FD32DFBC440` in `push rdi` before the `key[]` array is mentioned) and writing that into the `got.plt` section. This time, instead of being hooked to where we are, it's hooked to the decrypted `Anomaly2[]` buffer that we'd just wrote into.

`load_rdi_with_some_popraxret_func_addr`, as confusing as it is, does some manipulation to the `rdi` and `rsi` registers such that they both point the end of `dec_rax_till_fceb5dc3` and the start of the whole initial hooked `getchar()` instruction block. Feel free to reference the [commented instructions](#hooked-getchar-commented-assembly) below to get a better idea of what's going on.

`cld` and `rep movsb` then wipes all of the instructions from `rsi` to `rdi`, rendering them `0`s as we see here:

![alt text](Images/image-32.png)

Finally, another `syscall-mprotect` is made to change the input buffer from `RWX` back to `RX`.

![alt text](Images/image-33.png)

In summary, our hooked `getchar()` does the following:
```
1. Call getchar() as normal till user finishes the first maze
2. Calls mprotect to prepare libc buffer for further modification
3. Reads data from Anomaly2[]
4. Xor decrypts with Key[], another constant variable and appends to the end of the initial hook function
5. Rehook getchar@got.plt to the decrypted function
6. Wipe previous data of the initial hook
7. Call a final mprotect to reset the libc buffer back to RX from RWX
```

In [Tunnel's End](#tunnels-end), we will analyse the new hooked function and observe how this finally leads us to the flag.

## Tunnel's End

We finally arrive at the second hooked `getchar()`! We'll refer to this function as `Tunnels_End()` for the remainder of this writeup.

Once again much like `secret_func` the pseudocode output is rather messy so we'll stick with assembly as we'd done with the previous two big functions. This last segment would be slightly shorter than the rest as I would like to not go in depth as I'd done with the previous two, but rather talk about how I was able to solve it with inferences.

As scuffed as it is, this is generally how most of RE is done. Then the gaps are filled during writeup creation. Plus, by this point this writeup should have given you the ability and confidence to handle raw assembly anyway ;D

![alt text](Images/image-34.png)

Right off the bat our first question on how exactly and where this new hooked function calls the proper `getchar()` is is answered. Which means the rest of the function is no longer about hooking `getchar()`, and it is where things start to happen.

![alt text](Images/image-35.png)

We then see how this `rax` is compared with `WASD`, and all of them are funneled into an instruction chain. There is a stray red arrow at the end of an attempt to check if `rax == 'D'`. The red arrow just leads to a return call, and ends the hook without any problems or changes whatsoever.

An interesting piece of trivia is that the `rax` register is often used to store the return value of functions. Thus, since `getchar()` (the proper libc one) was called in this hook, `rax` would contain the user's input character.

We can easily infer that Interestingly we observe that our 4 possible inputs perform different things to two registers in particular.

```
W -> rdi = 1, r15 -= 0x12
D -> rdi = 4, r15 += 1
S -> rdi = 3, r15 += 0x12
A -> rdi = 2, r15 -= 1
```

We also notice that the first time this hooked function is called, `r15` starts at `0x39`. This will be relevant later on.

Now your inferrence skills might activate and you'd notice a key thing about it that completely divulges what this whole hook is doing. Regardless, we'll move on and see what happens after processing our input character;

![alt text](Images/image-36.png)

First off, a bunch of items are repeatedly pushed into the stack. Now, if you've caught on by the things that `WDSA` are doing here, this would probably lead you to the [Intended Solution](#intended-solution). Unfortunately, I didn't catch onto that yet, and wound up pulling an accidental solve after further looking through the function.

![alt text](Images/image-37.png)

Once this series of strings have been loaded, we observe operations done involving the `r15` and `rdi` registers, which culminate in one of three possible options. `r8 = 0, 1, 2`. `r11` is also an important register that's affected, which comes in later.

This leads to 3 different "endings" in which `Tunnels_End` returns from. A Good Ending, a Bad Ending and a Neutral Ending.

### Good Ending

The "Good Ending" occurs when `r8 = 2`, and it was the first path that caught my attention.
![alt text](Images/image-38.png)

It uses the stack data as shown in `[rsp+60h+var_C8]` and subsequent data in it from the `mov rdx, [rsi+rcx*4]` instruction in the first loop shown to compute some value `rax` that it pushes onto the stack.

It then xors the `ct_buffer[]` -- The same one used in `win_func()` to call `RC4` on -- modifying the buffer data with some byte array. The `rdi` register is used to store the location of this `ct_buffer[]` array.

![alt text](Images/image-39.png)
Finally, the `rax` value is popped off the stack to restore the register which seems to be a checksum of the data on the stack. This is followed with more operations done to the registers before it merges with the case where `r8 == 1`, which we'll see in the [Bad Ending](#bad-ending)

### Bad Ending

The "Bad Ending" occurs when `r8 = 1`. Both the Good and Bad Ending paths merge here, but what makes this ending bad is that the `ct_buffer[]` used in `win_func()` was never altered at all.

![alt text](Images/image-40.png)

Firstly, another `mprotect()` is called which makes this entire buffer modifiable once more.

```
lea rdi, Tunnels_End+2
mov rsi, [rdi]
mov rdx, offset getchar_gotplt
mov [rdx], rsi
```

These 4 instructions essentially store a pointer with the address of `getchar()` in the libc into `rdi`, then stores the address of said function into `rsi`, which finally overwrites the `getchar` entry in the `got.plt` section back to what it originally was, being its actual location in the libc. This essentially "unhooks" `getchar()` and restores it to what it once was way, way before `secret_func()` had been called.

Lastly, `rdi` and `rsi` are set, and a `cld -> rep movsb` wipes off the entire hooked function. This ends with another `mprotect` syscall to set it back to `RX`, thus ending the hook overall.

### Neutral Ending
The "Neutral Ending" occurs when `r8 = 0`.
![alt text](Images/image-41.png)

We see an `mprotect` setting the libc buffer to `RWX` again, and this time something happens to the `rdi` register based on the `r11` register.

![alt text](Images/image-42.png)

Stuff is modified, but not as drastic as that in the Good and Bad Endings respectively. Another `mprotect` is made to set it back to `RX` and the hooked function ends.

With all of this in mind, I kinda performed a slightly unintended route to obtain the flag. This writeup presents both the Unintended and Intended Solutions.

## Unintended Solution
```
Recommended to at least read Tunnel's End for context here, as well as some familiarity with what the binary has been doing in A Cursory Glance.
```

Not exactly fully aware of what was going on at the time, I thought of expressing this hooked function as some graph traversal problem. The idea was that each `WASD` input by the user causes `r15` to change which impacts `r8`. Ultimately this `r8` value would either be `0`, `1`, or `2`, and we would want to ignore `1`s.

I had also observed from running the binary and with lots of snapshots that getting `r8` to be `0` or `2` usually occurs once in every 4 possible inputs, and that the `r15` register is never touched or modified between every time `Tunnels_End()` is called.

```py
# Load stack data over
s = ['FFFFFFFF', 
     'FC0F0303', 
     'EFCCC303', 
     '0C3CDCFF', 
     'FCF3CFCF', 
     '00C03C0C', 
     'F3CFFFFC', 
     'CF30C03C', 
     '0C033CF3', 
     'CFFFF00C', 
     '3C300FFF', 
     'CFF03C00', 
     '00FFFFFF', 
     '0000FFFF']
s = [int(i,16) for i in s]

# Simulate r15 changes
def test(r15):
    if r15 >= (len(s))*16:
       return False
    rax = r15 // 16 + 1
    rdx = r15 % 16

    r8 = s[rax-1]
    rdx <<= 1
    rdx = 0x1e - rdx
    r8 >>= rdx
    r8 &= 3
    return r8 == 0 or r8 == 2

def dfs(path, moves):
    if 0x21 in path:
        print(moves, max(path))
    for i in "WASD":
        r15 = path[-1]
        if i == "W":
            r15 -= 0x12
        elif i == "D":
            r15 += 1
        elif i == "A":
            r15 -= 1
        else:
            r15 += 0x12
        if test(r15) and r15 not in path:
            dfs(path + [r15], moves + i)

moves = ""
path = [0x39]
dfs(path, moves)
```
I copied the stack data over, then fully reversed and simulatedwhat happens to the r8 register each time. I then ran a Depth-First-Search script arriving at these possible paths. Initially there were a lot more, and I banked on intuition that you probably aren't supposed to go back to where you'd originally come from, and that the `r15` value should always be unique each time.

```
Testing each path gave an error due to some stack index being out of reach. The only one that worked was the last one with the path having the highest index value of `195`.

Interacting with the second maze (whereupon `Tunnels_End` is the new `getchar()` hook), I entered the series of inputs `WWAASSSSDDSSAASSDSDDWDDDSDDDDDDDDWWDWWAAASSAAAWWDWWAAASSSAAAWWWWWDWDDSDDWDDSDSSDDDWWAW`, which led to my program breakpointing at the `Good Ending` segment!

Once the `ct_buffer[]` had been modified, I'd extracted it and ran my RC4 script, thus getting the flag:

```py
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4

key = bytes.fromhex("4455621D5D46F92C325E625FB595F69E674B3A29980C129019E8C1B4F7A60B22")
new_ct = bytes.fromhex("84F45B8296B937AD24B4AA85F1BF35134AB57B0B18390C8846F4C3B7B5522D61C4B9DBAD30160AE5D2209400")
cipher = ARC4.new(key=key)
print(cipher.decrypt(new_ct)) # b'grey{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n51gh7_35ffcbede152a94e}\xa3'
```

## Intended Solution
```
Recommended to at least read Tunnel's End for context here, as well as some familiarity with what the binary has been doing in A Cursory Glance.
```

Mazeware, is all about mazes and navigating through them. Consider implementing a maze, maybe as a string for instance. And let's say we wish to implement the basic 2-dimensional maze.

How do we represent the y and x coordinates of an individual? Well, suppose we already know that our maze has some length N. Then it becomes rather trivial. Store our maze in a single string with every consecutive row appended to the next. Set a pointer navigating through this array to represent the player's location. To move left/right, subtract/add the pointer by 1. To move up/down, subtract/add the pointer by N.

```
W -> rdi = 1, r15 -= 0x12
D -> rdi = 4, r15 += 1
S -> rdi = 3, r15 += 0x12
A -> rdi = 2, r15 -= 1
```

Now this seems awfully familiar. Looking back at what the second hooked `getchar` is pushing onto the stack, the `0`s look a lot like paths that snake through walls defined by `F`s and possibly `C`s too.

```py
# Load stack data over
s = ['FFFFFFFF', 
     'FC0F0303', 
     'EFCCC303', 
     '0C3CDCFF', 
     'FCF3CFCF', 
     '00C03C0C', 
     'F3CFFFFC', 
     'CF30C03C', 
     '0C033CF3', 
     'CFFFF00C', 
     '3C300FFF', 
     'CFF03C00', 
     '00FFFFFF', 
     '0000FFFF']
s = ''.join([format(int(i,16), "032b") for i in s])
for i in range(0,len(s),0x12):
    print(s[i:i+0x12])
```
Copying over the stack data and printing it out we obtain;
```

which doesn't look quite right. But then you might notice how a `00` and `11` could represent a path and wall respectively, meaning instead of it being of length `0x12` its of length `0x24`, and thus with a quick change of numbers,

```
111111111111111111111111111111111111

Now this looks more like a maze. Chekhov's Anomaly1 and Anomaly2 had came in super handy when we were stuck in our analysis prior, so surely Chekhov's Maze can't be a coincidence. Or it could be an easter egg in the end.

One thing that stuck out was that while `11` represented walls and `00` paths, there also existed `01` and `10`. Guessing that `01` was the player character (also because `0x39`, the initial value of `r15`, would correspond the exact index where `01` is) and that `10` was the destination, we can navigate through this maze, with shortest route being `WWAASSSSDDSSAASSDSDDWDDDSDDDDDDDDWWDWWAAASSAAAWWDWWAAASSSAAAWWWWWDWDDSDDWDDSDSSDDDWWAW`.

In fact, upon reaching the end, we hit the [Good Ending](#good-ending) route in [Tunnels End](#tunnels-end), which alters the `ct_buffer[]` used in `win_func`. We can then copy the new `ct_buffer[]` and run RC4 much like in [Unintended](#unintended-solution) to get the flag, `grey{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n51gh7_35ffcbede152a94e}`
