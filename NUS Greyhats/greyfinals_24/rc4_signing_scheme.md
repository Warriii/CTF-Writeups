This time we have the server implementing an RC4 signature oracle. The oracle implements a standard RC4 encryption algorithm to sign its messages, using an iv and a private key.

With each instance that we ask for a signature, it signs a constant unknown `secret_msg` with a different 128 byte `iv` and a constant 128 byte `priv_key`. The RC4 key used in question is determined by concatenating the `iv` with `priv_key`, forming a 256-bit key used in key scheduling and subsequently generating the RC4 keystream.

To get the flag, we must be able to somehow obtain a valid signature of `secret_msg`, but we must give it an `iv` that is different from the ones the server has shown to us thus far. We can't compute `priv_key` meaning we can never really obtain a `iv + priv_key` key to custom RC4 encrypt a message, and we don't even have `secret_msg` to begin with!

It was quite an interesting journey when I'd solved this. I went off tangent looking at cryptographic papers on key collisions in RC4, and tried to implement one but to no success. But after a quick lunch and some time staring at the code I found the solution;

The trick is to realise that `RC4` is a stream cipher. Much like `AES-CTR` it generates a keystream that is initialised by the input key given. This keystream is primarily generated from the result of a state array `S` that is initialised by the RC4 key (`iv + priv_key`), which occurs in the key scheduling algorithm.

```py
def keyschedule(key):
    S = list(range(256))
    j = 0
    for i in range(256):
         j = (j + S[i] + key[i%len(key)])%256
         t = S[i]
         S[i] = S[j]
         S[j] = t
    return S
```

Notice how our 256-byte key winds up modifying the initial `S` array by swapping values within with each byte in the key. Since we know the `iv`, even though we don't have the `iv + priv_key` key, we can trace through `iv` and see what the `S` array would look like right before it gets affected by the `priv_key`.

So for any given `iv`, we can trace through `S` to get to some partial `S'`. Now, to gain a valid signature, all we need to do is to find some other 128-byte `iv'` that would preserve the same mapping that `iv` does from `S` to `S'`.

From `S` and `S'`, notice that we can deduce where every `i` value `S` is mappedto in `S'`. If we're lucky (i.e. around 50% of the time), the `S'` array would only have exactly `128` of its bytes moved. We use these same `128` bytes to construct another `iv'` that accomplishes the same movement by reversing through the key scheduling algorithm.

There is a near negligible chance of us deriving the same `iv` value as what we have, and by submitting this new `iv` value as well as the same signature, we spoof a valid signature and thus obtain our flag.

I ran this about 4 times and then managed to get the flag,
`grey{rc4_more_like_rcgone_amirite_q20v498n20}`
