We see the same server oracle as in [Intro to AES 1](crypto_intro_to_aes.md) but this time `CBC` is used as the AES encryption mode.

This time however, the server defines a `iv`, `key`, and then given a message to encrypt `msg`, returns `AES_CBC(key, iv, iv+msg)`. It does this on the flag and returns this value to us.

We have access to a decryption oracle whereby it decrypts `msg` directly without `iv+msg`, but it returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the decryption had been successful.

But what exactly is CBC encryption/decryption?

### AES CBC Mode
![alt text](images/cbc_enc.png)

AES CBC is simply put an extension of AES ECB. A key weakness in AES ECB is that the same 16 bytes will always encrypt/decrypt to the same 16 bytes. AES CBC tries to circumvent this flaw by having results from the previous block affect the current block.

When encrypting a plaintext block, CBC mode first xors it with the output result of the previous ciphertext block; It then runs it through AES ECB and outputs the ciphertext. This "chains" blocks together, hence its name, `Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)`.

In the challenge, `iv+flag` is being encrypted. Thus, if we view the 48-byte output of the encrypted flag (which you get when you ncat to the server), we essentially have our blocks


```
           C0         |         C1       |        C2
           =                    =                 = 
AES_ECB(NULL_byte*16) | AES_ECB(F0 ^ C0) | AES_EBC(F1 ^ C1)
```

where `F0`, `F1` denote our flag in 16 byte blocks.

An interesting thing to note is we can take `C0` as our "iv", manner of speaking, and running CBC decrypt on `C1 | C2` would decrypt into `F0` and `F1`.

But we can't just get the flag, as we only receive a True or False on whether our decryption would succeed. Wouldn't this always be True?

### CBC Padding Oracle Attack!

Not exactly. A key observation here is that `message = unpad(padded_message, 16)` is called in `decrypt()`. `unpad()` takes the last byte value of the padded_message and removes that many bytes off of the message, thus "unpadding" a padded message.

Normally, if your message is say, 15 blocks, 1 block of padding will be needed and thus pycryptodome appends your message with `b'\x01'` before encryption. When decrypting, it'll receive your message + `b'\x01'`. `unpad()` would detect this `b'\x01'` and remove exactly 1 byte from the end, thus returning your message. To prevent `unpad()` from taking off your message, `unpad()` makes sure that the bytes its removing are all the same value; A 12 byte valid padding would be `b'\x0c\x0c..\x0c` 12 times, etc.

Thus, consider if we mess with block `C2`, such that the decrypted output no longer ends on its proper padding block. `unpad()` would return an error, and thus `decrypt()` would return False. `decrypt()` would only return True if the message has been decrypted to contain a valid padding.

Inverting our CBC encryption diagram we get;

Notice how the previous block is used to xor with the output of `AES_ECB_decrypt()` to get the plaintext.

Suppose we want to say, determine the last byte value of our flag. We'll let `F0` and `F1` denote our 16 byte flag blocks, `C0` and `C1` as their encrypted counterparts and set our goal to determine the last value of `F1`. We'll let this value be `x`.

What we can do is change the last byte of `C0`. There's only 256 possibilities for this byte to take, and when we do so there are only 2 possibilities for a successful `unpad()`.

1. The last byte of `AES_ECB_Decrypt(F1)` is xored with an unmodified `C0`, thus returning a valid result. Let the unmodified last byte of `C0` be `y0`.
2. The last byte of `AES_ECB_Decrypt(F1)` is xored with a modified `F0` byte to get `b'\x01'`. `unpad()` here would work as it'll strip just one byte, and not return an error. Suppose in this scenario the last byte of `C0` is `y1`.

We can thus construct an equation,

```
x ^ y0 == AES_ECB_DECRYPT(C1_last_byte) == 0x01 ^ y1
Therefore,
x == 0x01 ^ y0 ^ y1
```

And thus we recover the value of `x`. Now, to get the second last value we aim to produce a valid padding of `\x02\x02` (we can now customise the last byte of a decrypted `C1` to be anything having now known the last byte of `F1`), and thus recover the next character of the flag.

This attack to slowly recover the flag character by character is known as a CBC Padding Oracle Attack.

All we need to do is to implement the attack on the server, and recover the flag.
