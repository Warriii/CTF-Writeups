## Introduction

hi hi am Crypto CTF hobbyist Warri

Recently I participated in NUS Greyhats Welcome CTF 2024. A friend `elijah5399`asked if I could play in his team `G04T3DP30PL3`, after which we managed to get `1st` with a total score of `35493` points, myself having acquired `16130`.

Throughout the 48 hours we managed to solve 46 out of the 50 challenges.

Overall the CTF was quite engaging and fun. In addition, as compared to last year I was able to solve all of the crypto challenges! ^_^

This set of writeups will include the challenges I'd solved. In a similar vein to last year I will dump what I know of the encryption algorithms featured in the ctfs, primarily `RSA`, `AES` and some bit of `Linear Algebra`.

Writeups will be provided for the following challenges that I was able to solve;
