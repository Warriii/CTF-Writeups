Hoped everyone enjoyed DEADSEC CTF this July!

I had the honour to set a reverse engineering challenge for it, of which became a tad bit controversial. But I will save this conversation for my writeup on it.

Anyway, I had a blast solving challenges on the admin account (trying to get flags from cryptography challenges but not flagging them of course). I assumed I was not allowed to play as the top team gets to compete in MaltaCTF Finals this September, and being a challenge setter for both MaltaCTF Qualifiers and Finals probably makes this a conflict of interest.

While I was not able to full clear the Cryptography category, I had an enjoyable time upsolving the various challenges. This writeup will cover ALL of the Cryptography challenges, including my one RE challenge submission.

While most of the distribution files can be found in the writeups themselves, both `crypto_polymao` and `re_carwatching` have large distributions. I have zipped them accordingly and left them in this repository, under `polymao.zip` and `carwatching.zip` respectively.
