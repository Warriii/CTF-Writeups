The ISC2 Singapore is an organisation dedicated to foster cybersecurity skills among members. I had the opportunity to be invited by one of the organisers, `gatari`, to set ctf challenges for the Chapter Capture The Flag (CTF) Competition held on the last week of August!

It was an enjoyable experience setting up challenges for the CTF, and to allow for others to see the challenges I'd set I intend on releasing my writeups for them here!

Around 44 participants turned up for the CTF which wasn't much, but I hope everyone had an enjoyable experience!

Writeups will be provided for the following challenges:

### Misc - griddle (1 Solve, 1000 pts)
